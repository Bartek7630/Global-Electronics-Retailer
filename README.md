I created four queries to thoroughly examine it and present my findings. A lot of information came out of it, as I wanted the analysis to be truly detailed.

Query 1:

1. Market Dominance Patterns
United States (largest market):
Top product: "Adventure Works Desktop PC1.60 ED160 Silver" (100 orders)
Represents only 0.30% of total US orders (33,767)
Shows highly fragmented demand in large market
United Kingdom:
Top product: "Contoso DVD External DVD Burner M200 Grey" (26 orders)
0.32% of total orders (8,140)
Similar fragmentation pattern to US
Australia:
Top product: "Adventure Works Desktop PC1.60 ED160 White" (15 orders)
0.51% of total orders (2,941)
Slightly more concentrated demand than larger markets

Query 2:

1. Strong Seasonal Trends
- December is consistently the peak month every year (15-18% of annual orders), suggesting holiday shopping drives significant demand
- February is another strong month (10-12% of orders), possibly due to post-holiday sales or Valentine's Day promotions

2. Growth Trajectory
- Total order volume grew significantly from 2016 (6,900 orders) to 2019 (21,600 orders) - more than 3Ã— increase
- 2020 shows a dramatic shift:
* First two months were exceptionally strong (22-24% of annual orders)
* March-December saw significantly reduced activity, likely due to pandemic impacts

3. Consistent Patterns Across Years
The same months consistently perform well/poorly each year, suggesting predictable seasonal demand
Q4 (Oct-Dec) typically accounts for 30-40% of annual orders
Q2 (Apr-Jun) is usually the weakest quarter (exception: May 2020)

Query 3:

1. Overall Improvement in Delivery Times
- Significant year-over-year reduction in delivery days:
* 2016 average: 7.29 days
* 2017 average: 5.19 days (28.8% improvement)
* 2018 average: 4.31 days (further 17% improvement)
* The company achieved remarkable efficiency gains in its logistics operations between 2016-2018

2. Seasonal Patterns
* Consistent monthly variations:
- Q1 (Jan-Mar): Typically slower delivery (positive variance)
- Mid-year (Jun-Jul): Often faster than annual average
- December: Frequently shows faster delivery times (negative variance) despite being peak order month

Query 4:

1. Store Performance Extremes
* Top Performers:
- Store 43: $332.69 daily sales (highest among older stores)
- Store 49: $372.89 daily sales (remarkable for a newer store)
* Lowest Performers:
- Store 2: Just $2.41 daily sales (worst performing)
- Store 14: $18.87 daily sales

2. No Clear Correlation Between Age and Performance
* Some of the oldest stores (7348 days active) show:
- Store 9: $181.84 daily (average)
- Store 37: $114.59 daily (below average)
* Some newer stores (<5000 days) outperform older ones:
- Store 59: 4634 days, $281.03 daily
- Store 65: 4854 days, $252.38 daily
